javascript code run in javascript run time environment 
javascript engine is the heart of javascript run time environment
javascript engine is diff in diff browser and nodejs etc 
javascript engine consist of diff phases 
1. parsing 
2. complilation
3. execution

parsing --> it is a phase in which code is converted into tokens and then it is arrange in AST abstract systax Tree 
this AST
compilation --> this AST then passes through a interprettor js has a interprettor --> meaning which run the 
code line by line and then execute 
execution --> this interprettor converte the AST into bytecode and this bytecode then execute using execution and 
memory heap and call stack 
interprettor code also passes through complier which compile the code to optimize machine code 
and then this machine code converted to bytecode and then execute. 
this technique of interprettor and complilation of AST side by side is called Just in time compilation (JIT)
compilation
